# assignments and grading

This semester, I have decided to dispense with my normal large historiography
project, traditionally constituted of a review of 15-20 additional works to the
reading list. Instead, we will spread the reading and writing out through the
course of the semester.

Student’s overall grade will be based on a combination of three review papers
and participation/leading discussion.

1. Review Essays (70% of grade). Students must write three review essays during
   the course of the semester. The first two essays (20% of final grade each) cover the
   historiographical development of work in the field in two stages. The first
   should analyze the development of work from the first chronicles through
   the emergence of social history. The second should review the shift to New
   Conquest History. Particular attention should be paid to the evidential
   base of the books, how they relate to one another, and the historiographic role they play in
   the field of Conquest history. What are the most and least
   persuasive elements of the argument? How persuasive is the general
   argument? Which source base was most important for the works under
   consideration? How do individual works conform with or deviate from the
   general stages of the historiography as identified by Lockhart and
   Restall?

   The final essay (30% of final grade) will require students to read Todorov, and critique his
   work based on their views of Conquest at the end of the seminar.

   Please be concise, yet erudite. If you need guidance, you might read some
   essays in Reviews in American History or imagine shorter versions of what
   is done in History Compass. Pay attention to your writing. Consult Joseph
   Williams’ Style: Toward Clarity and Grace (you can dispense with Strunk and
   White, already!).

   Review essays are due at the start of class.

2. Leading Class Discussion (30% of grade). Each student will pick a week to
   lead discussion. For each week, even those in which no student is assigned,
   everyone must email the collective with a short reaction for the
   discussion of the books – questions, observations, etc.
   Questions/observations must be submitted no later than Wednesday morning.
   Leaders should also research authors and reviews of the books, try to chart
   the intellectual and historiographical lineage of the work under
   consideration.

And that is it.
