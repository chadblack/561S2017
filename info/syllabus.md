# about

> *The Discovery of America,
  and that of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, are the
  two greatest and most important events in the recorded history of mankind.*
>
  -Adam Smith

In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue and… discovered, or destroyed,
conquered, or civilized the Americas.  Sixty years later, in 1552, López de
Gómara, the private secretary of Hernán Cortes, wrote, “The greatest event
since the creation of the world (excluding the incarnation and death of Him who
created it) is the discovery of the Indies [i.e. Americas].”  He was, himself,
a participant the great conquest of Mexico.  From the very beginning, not only
the magnitude, but also the meaning of the Conquest of the Americas has been a
point of controversy and acclaim.  Worlds were upended. Millions of people died
through the cumulative impacts of warring, labor practices, and, maybe most
importantly, disease. Empires were torn down and reconstructed. Christendom was
vastly expanded. And, of course, tomatoes, chiles, potatoes, silver, gold,
emeralds, horses, cattle, pig, corn, and syphilis traversed the Atlantic in an
epoch of unprecedented ecological exchange. Modernity itself was forged in the
crucible of Conquest.  The readings in this class will take us on a journey
through the historiography of the Conquest, from its original Spanish and
indigenous chroniclers through current approaches. Along the way we will treat
the complexities, myths, and enduring legacies of the process of Spanish
conquest. 

Texts:  Several books have been ordered for this seminar and are available for
purchase at the UTK bookstore. All other readings will be available via the
course website. All students should give serious consideration to purchasing
James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz’s textbook *Early Latin America*, which will
provide a general framework for understanding this period of Latin American
History.

# course objectives

1. Students will build familiarity with the broader historiographic development
   of research on the history of the Spanish Conquest. 

2. Students will be able to identify the source base, theoretical emphases, and
   empirical methods that cluster across the periods of historiography of the
   Spanish Conquest.

3. Students will hone their ability to analyze, synthesize, and communicate in
   written and oral forms these historiographic trends.

Reading, writing, and oral assignments for this course are designed to meet
these three goals. In meeting them, you will also be able to place the Spanish
Conquest into larger historiographic and pedagogical frameworks.
